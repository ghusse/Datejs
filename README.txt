This repository is a fork of datejs, which seems to be abandonned.

Changes:
[19th May 2011]
- The "build" directory now contains tools for building an up-to-date release of datejs. The old content was totally outdated. Google closure compiler is provided in this directory with a windows batch that builds every localized version of datejs.
